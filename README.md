# Interactive-AI-Playground

**This repository was created for the master project in the third semester of the Interactive Media master at the University of Applied Sciences Media Department in Hagenberg.**

It is a build up on the semester project, which was created in the second semester. 
The semester project focused on exploring "Explainable AI," particularly within the context of neural networks and the traceability of their results back to the training data. Our research aimed to develop methods to interpret and understand the outputs of complex models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and image generation AIs.

To allow everyone to experiment easily with our new foundational findings, we created a "playground" to be used in Google Colab.

The tests for the best metrics to use within the LLM part of the Interactive Playground can be found here. Since the data was provided locally, it is not intended to run it but serves just as an informational source.
