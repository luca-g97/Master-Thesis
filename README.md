# Interactive-AI-Playground

**This repository was created for the semesterproject in the second semester of the Interactive Media master at the University of Applied Sciences Media Department in Hagenberg.**

The semester project focused on exploring "Explainable AI," particularly within the context of neural networks and the traceability of their results back to the training data. Our research aimed to develop methods to interpret and understand the outputs of complex models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and image generation AIs.

To allow everyone to experiment easily with our new foundational findings, we created a "playground" to be used in Google Colab.
